The power of the metaphor comes from the manner in which it captures the everyday understandings (1) that cooperative relationships can be productive to all parties involved-mutual cooperation is more productive in the aggregate than any other outcome; but (2) that exploiting another's cooperative behavior can be more rewarding to an individual than mutual cooperation; and (3) cooperative relation- ships are risky-there is always the chance of being "suckered" by a partner who "free rides" on one's own contribution.

Most analyses of the Prisoner's Dilemma have neglected the fact that the two partners the story are prisoners-they have been captured, placed in separate cells, denied communication among themselves, and forced to play the game invented by the District Attorney (exceptions are Marwell and Schmitt 1975; Orbell, Schwartz-Shea and Simmons 1984; Tullock 1985; Yamagishi 1988; Schuessler 1989; Vanberg and Congleton 1992.) These prisoners have no option other than choosing between confessing or denying.
